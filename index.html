                Hello! My name is Kai Reid. I am 19 years old and was born and raised in Savannah, Georgia. Some things I enjoy to do in
                my free time are: skateboarding, making music, and learn new things. Before joining this bootcammp, I attended Georgia Southern
                University and was undecided (as far as my major goes). Towards the end of my freshman year, I decided that I wanted to major in Computer Science,
                thus launching my interest in this field. I didn't know about this bootcamp until my brother told me about it; and I am happy
                he did because I don't think I would've been satisfied spending thousands of dollars on a CS degree when I know that experience
                matters more in this industry (although having a CS degree does asssist in some aspects). Since my brother informed me about
                this bootcamp, I have been extensively researching everything I can to develop a solid understanding of core concepts that would
                assist me in this career. As you can tell, I am quite passionate about coding already and this bootcamp was the fuel to my fire. 
                My inclusion in this bootcamp has given me something to grind for, which before this bootcamp, I was not finding in college.
