# Project Title

Creating a responsive portfolio

## Description

For this project, I had to create a responsive portfolio website that would accomodate for (and still look good on) all devices. To accomplish this task, I used Bootstrap and utilized their grid system to position various elements onto the pages that I created. I also used custom CSS for certain styling that would assist with making the page more responsive and visually appealing.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To access this project, you would want to go in Git Bash (or any other terminal you use), pull all files within the "gt-atl-fsf-ft-08-2020-u-c" repo, go to the "02-Homework" folder within "02-CSS-Bootstrap", and copy both the "Assets" folder and the "README.md" (for referencing what you are suppose to be doing).

### Executing program

Open HTML file in a browser to view how it looks visually and to see how it operates.
